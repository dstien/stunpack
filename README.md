**Stunts/4D [Sports] Driving game resource unpacker**

This program decodes packed resources and code files used by the PC version of the game "Stunts" (Br√∏derbund), also published as "4D Sports Driving" (Mindscape) and "4D Driving" (Electronic Arts).

An encoder has not been made as the game accepts uncompressed resource files.

## Download

Pre-compiled binaries can be downloaded from the project's [release page](https://github.com/dstien/stunpack/releases).

## Usage

The program requires at least one parameter as the source file path. If the optional destination file path is omitted a new filename is generated by adding the `.out` extension to the source file name. Except for the DOS version, where the last character of the source file name is replaced by a `_` in the destination file name.

For a full list of options run `stunpack -h`.

## Building

The project can be compiled with the GNU toolchain by running `make`. Building for other targets can be achieved by setting a compiler/linker in the `CC` environment variable:
* Win32 with MinGW: `CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc make`
* Win64 with MinGW: `CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc make`
* MS DOS with Open Watcom: `CC=wcl386 INCLUDE=$WATCOM/h LIB=$WATCOM/lib386 PATH=$WATCOM/binl:$WATCOM/binw:$PATH make`
* Any target exposed by Zig's Clang interface: `CC="zig cc -target riscv64-linux-musl" make`

Variables that affects the build process:
* `CC`: Compiler executable
* `CFLAGS`: Compiler flags
* `LDFLAGS`: Linker flags
* `BUILDDIR`: Place output files in external directory
* `EXESUFFIX`: Defaults to `.exe` if a Windows or DOS compiler is detected
* `INSTALLDIR`: Defaults to `/usr/local/bin` for `make install`

## Library

The code for handling the compression formats is separated from the command line utility in a static library located in `src/lib`. The header file is `include/stunpack.h`.

## Additional documentation

The data format, compression algorithms and applied optimisations are described in the [Stunts Wiki](https://wiki.stunts.hu/wiki/Compression).
